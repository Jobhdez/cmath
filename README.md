C is actually a very interesting programming language. It is a very powerful language in that you can build really important systems such as operating systems ---
C gives you all the power that you need at this level.

Learning about pointers and memory allocation was fun. I had been working on this program in my repo `the-little-schemer` but for this project I wanted 
to "formalize" the program a little bit -- i.e., organizing the code in multiple `c` and `h` files and writing a `Makefile`. This was actually tremendously
fun. I got very excited when I got it working.
